this topic I would like to show how to manage a dataset with many features \n(especially numeric data with completely unclear meaning and influence on whole dataset)\nThe dataset contains speech features and clinical variables\nfrom participants of a depression related study. \nBased on speech recordings, vocal features have been derived from\ndifferent categories. \nEach feature contains a tag _{pos,neg}, which refers to the vocal task it\nwas extracted from. \nClinical and demographic variables of participants can be found at the beginning. \nThe study was meant to show a relation between voice patterns and depression scale (variable ADS). \n\nDescription:\n1: Participant identifier number in the study\n2 - 4: Participant recorded demographic information\n5: Depression score that records disturbances caused by depressive\nsymptoms on a scale of 0-60. The participants can be classified into\na group with (ADS &gt; 17) and without (ADS &lt; 17) depressive\nsymptoms.\n6 - 171: 84 speech features computed for negative and positive stories.\nColumn names contain feature names and the story sentiment it\nwas computed from. They are all separated by underscores i.e., speech_ratio_pos\nrefers to speech ratio computed for positive stories.\n172-215: 22 transcript features computed for negative and positive stories.\nColumn names contain features name and the story sentiment it\nwas computed, all separated by underscores i.e.,\nadjective_rate_neg refers to adjective rate computed for negative\nstories.\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom scipy.stats import  ttest_ind\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\ndf.shape\n(121, 215)\n\nGender is a categorical variable. It should be transformed to numerical value:\ndf['gender'].unique()\narray(['female', 'male'], dtype=object)\n# Coding categorical feature \"gender\" as 0- male , 1- female\ndf_gender = df['gender'].map(lambda x:0 if x=='male' else 1)\ndf['gender'] = df_gender\ndf.head()\n\nIt is not enough data to divide data on to subsets by gender.

detection based on speech data "},"https://nnovakova.github.io/cars-analysis/":{"body":"In this article I want to show some basic data preparation and analytics tasks. Also I want to shown Plotly library for data visualisation.\nI have been looking for some datasets that I can easily manipulate to demonstrate the first pre-step of the  Machine Learning - \ndata preparation and cleaning. So I started to surf the Internet for datasets I can somehow explain and easily interpret based on my experience. \n\nFor this tasks I used two Kaggle datasets:\n\nUA Cars dataset\nUS Cars dataset\n\nI think it is going to be fascinating to work with these datasets because of their visibility and simplicity.\nThe goal of this research is to show the common trends in the totaly different car markets as well as people preferences in different societies, but not to estimate total sales and so on. I believe this research is representative enough for this, but is not enough to assess this market.\nThe full source code you can find here: GitHub\nUkrainian Cars\nLet’s start with Ukrainian cars dataset. \nWe will use Pandas and Numpy libraries in this research.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nua_cars=pd.read_csv(\"cars/ua_vehicle_price.csv\")\n\nLet's look deeper into the columns:\nua_cars.columns\nIndex(['brand', 'model', 'year', 'body', 'price$', 'car_mileage', 'fuel',\n       'power', 'transmission'],\n      dtype='object')\nua_cars.head(10)\n\nCalculate total amount of cars by brand.\n#Total count cars by brands\nua_cars[\"brand\"].value_counts().head(10).plot(kind='bar')\n\nHere we see that Volkswagen is a top brand in UA. It make sense to me either, because there are a lot of VW models available for majority of car users in Ukraine.\nNext let’s describe numeric and categorical variables in the dataset:\n#Statistic for numerical features\nua_cars.describe()\n\nIn this table we can see that data has some strange behaviour and the reason for that can be the outliers. \nFor example the max power = 35, when mean = 2.125 and min = 0.1. So this dataset needs more transformations.\nCar mileage looks better and we can accurately say that average car mileage is 215 176 km.\n#Statistic for categorical features\nua_cars.astype('object').describe().transpose()\n\nHere we see again that top brand is VW, and top model is “Passat”. The top \nVery interesting observation is that the most  popular body type in Ukraine is a sedan. It is one more point to my assumption. Actually my guess is that in general Ukrainian drivers prefer cheap economical sedans, probably with manual transmission and diesel fuel. This is a perfect description of \"People's car\" (Volkswagen).\nI would like to see all possible types of cars:\n# All possible transmission types in ua_cars DataFrame\nua_cars[\"transmission\"].unique()\narray(['manual', 'automatic', 'other', 'typtronik', 'adaptive', nan],\n      dtype=object)\n\nThere is some strange type like 'typtronik'. Nevertheless, I am interested more in manual and automatic types as they are more common.\nIt looks like that data in the data frame has incorrect types and should be transformed.\n# Colums info for ua_cars DataFrame\nua_cars.info()\n\nRename some columns for convenience:\n#Rename colums in ua_cars DataFrame\nua_cars.rename(columns={\"price$\":\"price\",\"car_mileage\":\"mileage\"},inplace = True)\n\nHere we see that price has object type, but it has to be a numeric. To fix that, we need to apply data type transformation.\n#As we see in the REPL output, some of the colums should have another type than they have \n#Price is object, but should be integer or float\n#Change price column type\nua_cars[[\"price\"]] = ua_cars[[\"price\"]].apply(pd.to_numeric,errors='coerce') \nua_cars.head(5)\nua_cars.info()\n\nSo now it is time for some analytics. I would like to group data by some important, in my opinion, features and then compare them. \n#Group cars by transmission and years and calculate their counts\nua_transmission = ua_cars.groupby(['transmission','year'])['year'].count().reset_index(name='count')\nprint(ua_transmission)\n\nHere I calculate the amount of cars sold each year and group by transmission type for each year.\nIt will be good to see how it looks like in the graph. I am prefer use Plotly library for visualisation.\n#import plotly lib for the further visualisation\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nSave grouped transmission type into separate dataframes.\n#Extract main transmission types in separate dataframes \nua_adaptive_transmission=ua_transmission[ua_transmission['transmission']=='adaptive']\n\nua_automatic_transmission=ua_transmission[ua_transmission['transmission']=='automatic']\n\nua_manual_transmission=ua_transmission[ua_transmission['transmission']=='manual']\n\nNow it is time to draw:\nadaptive_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = ua_adaptive_transmission.year,\n    y = ua_adaptive_transmission['count'],\n    name = \"adaptive transmission\"\n)\nautomatic_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = ua_automatic_transmission.year,\n    y = ua_automatic_transmission['count'],\n    name = \"automatic transmission\"\n)\nmanual_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = ua_manual_transmission.year,\n    y = ua_manual_transmission['count'],\n    name = \"manual transmission\"\n)\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    title='Amount of cars sold during a year by transmission types',\\\n    xaxis= {'title':\"years\"},yaxis = {'title':\"total amount of cars\"},)\n\n\nfig = go.Figure(data = [adaptive_trace,automatic_trace,manual_trace], layout = layout)\niplot(fig)\n\nFrom this graph we can see:\n\nthat manual transmission cars were super popular in Ukraine till 2012. \nLast years we saw the trend that automatic transmission became more and more popular. We can affirm that automatic transmission will become an absolute lead on Ukrainian market next years.\nTotal amount of sales for both transmission types in UA are going down. Perhaps, it is due to economical reason.\nThe top sale years for manual transmission are 2007-2008 and for automatic are 2015-2016.\n\nFurther I would like to compare two of the most popular brands (Toyota nad Volkswagen) in time.\nGroup data by brand, year and compare the max price for each.\n#Total Toyota/VolksWagen sales by year\nmax_price = ua_cars.groupby(['brand', 'year'])['price'].max() \\\n  .reset_index(name='price').sort_values(['year'], ascending=False) \n\ntoyota_price=max_price[max_price['brand']=='toyota']\nvw_price=max_price[max_price['brand']=='volkswagen']\n\nUse scatterplot to visualise this data:\ntoyota_trace = go.Scatter(\n    x = toyota_price.year,\n    y = toyota_price['price'],\n    name = 'Toyota'\n)\nvw_trace = go.Scatter(\n    x = vw_price.year,\n    y = vw_price['price'],\n    name= 'VolksWagen'\n)\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    title='Total sales by year',\\\n    xaxis= {'title':\"years\"},yaxis = {'title':\"total sales,K$\"}\n)\n\nfig = go.Figure(data = [toyota_trace,vw_trace], layout = layout)\niplot(fig)\n\nHere we can see that both top brands have a good sales growth. \nVolkswagen has more stable sales, but Toyota has more tricky trend. Some last years are more lucky for Toyota and the growth is \nextremely sharp (in 2015 and 2019). It is a point for additional research.\n\nUSA Cars\nNow it is time to analyse another dataset - the dataset of US cars. It will be interesting to compare these two markets at the end.\nus_cars = pd.read_csv(\"cars/usa_vehicles_price.csv\")\n\nI’ll skip some code blocks, because they are similar to UA cars. I will just describe some results.\nUS cars dataset have next columns:\nIndex(['Unnamed: 0', 'price', 'brand', 'model', 'year', 'title_status',\n       'mileage', 'color', 'vin', 'lot', 'state', 'country', 'condition'],\n      dtype='object')\n\nThis dataset is wider by features and that is great. So maybe we can extract more interesting information here.\nus_cars[\"country\"].unique()  says to us this dataset collects info about Canada cars sold in US. \nI want to delete them, because now I am not sure how to interpret them in the future. \nAdditionally lets delete vin numbers - official car id number: they can’t give us more useful info.\nus_cars = us_cars.drop(['Unnamed: 0','vin',\"condition\",\"lot\",\"title_status\"],axis = 1)\nus_cars= us_cars[us_cars['country']==' usa']\nus_cars = us_cars.drop([\"country\"],axis = 1)\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I downloaded the dataset that mile units are used for US cars. Europeans “likes” American measures :-) \nSo let’s transform miles into kilometres:\nus_cars['mileage']=(us_cars['mileage']*1.60934/1000).round(0).astype(int)\n\nLet’s find top 10 popular brands in US:\nus_cars[\"brand\"].value_counts().head(10).plot(kind='bar')\n\nSo in US, Ford is a leader of sales. Dodge, Nissan and Chevrolet are popular too, but Ford is absolute leader.\nAlso we can group data by brand and year and compare their maximal prices:\nmax_price_us = us_cars.groupby(['brand', 'year'])['price'].max() \\\n  .reset_index(name='price').sort_values(['year'], ascending=False) \n\nford_price=max_price[max_price['brand']=='ford']\ndodge_price=max_price[max_price['brand']=='dodge']\nnissan_price=max_price[max_price['brand']=='nissan']\nchevrolet_price=max_price[max_price['brand']=='chevrolet']\n\nHere we see that there is no data about car prices for brands except Ford from the 40s till the middle of the 80s. \nI can explain that three other brands appeared in the US market just in the 80s.\nIn the 70s Ford sharply grew down and then started slightly growing up with other new brands only in the middle of the 2000s. \nIt looks like some crises on the market.  Dodge shows stable growth in the last 10 years. Three other brands have a few peaks. \nEspecially significant peaks for Nisan and Chevrolet in 2011-2012. I can guess that some new popular models appeared during this time.\nFords became a leader again on the market at 2018-2019.\nNext I would like to group data by the USA states, popular brands and review the trend:\ncar_by_state = us_cars.groupby(['state','brand'])['price'].max().reset_index(name='price')\n\n\nOk, now it is time for the most “cutie” side of the dataset. This is a car colour feature. I lived and visited a lot of countries \nand I see that each country has its own “character” also in car preferences. So I have some hypothesis about that and I want to get the proofs. \ncar_by_colors = us_cars.groupby('color')['model'].count().reset_index().sort_values('model',ascending = False).head(5)\nfig= pl.bar(car_by_colors, x='color',y='model')\nfig.show()\n\nOk, the colour number in US is white. Great! Less popular are black, grey/silver and red. \n(A brief digression: in Germany, the most popular car colours are black and dark grey. You don’t need to be an analytic to understand that. \nPeople explain that by cheaper prices for an insurance and subsequently such cars will be easier to sell. Other reasons are practicality and road safety).\nMy next goal to understand is some relationship between colour preference and state. \nI have an advice that in southern states white is more preferable than in northern and vice versa.\ncar_by_colors_state = us_cars.groupby(['color','state'])['state'].count().reset_index(name='count').sort_values('count',ascending = False)\n\nwhite_color_in_state=car_by_colors_state[car_by_colors_state['color']=='white'].head(5)\nblack_color_in_state=car_by_colors_state[car_by_colors_state['color']=='black'].head(5)\ngray_color_in_state=car_by_colors_state[car_by_colors_state['color']=='gray'].head(5)\nsilver_color_in_state=car_by_colors_state[car_by_colors_state['color']=='silver'].head(5)\nred_color_in_state=car_by_colors_state[car_by_colors_state['color']=='red'].head(5)\n\ncolor = {'White':'white',\n          'Black':'black',\n         'Gray':'gray',\n         'Silver':'silver',\n         'Red':'red'}\n\nwhite_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = white_color_in_state.state,\n    y = white_color_in_state['count'],\n    name = 'White',\n    marker_color=color['White']\n)\nblack_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = black_color_in_state.state,\n    y = black_color_in_state['count'],\n    name = 'Black',\n    marker_color=color['Black']\n)\ngray_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = gray_color_in_state.state,\n    y = gray_color_in_state['count'],\n    name = 'Gray',\n    marker_color=color['Gray']\n)\nsilver_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = silver_color_in_state.state,\n    y = silver_color_in_state['count'],\n    name = 'Silver',\n    marker_color=color['Silver']\n)\nred_trace = go.Bar(\n    x = red_color_in_state.state,\n    y = red_color_in_state['count'],\n    name = 'Red',\n    marker_color=color['Red']\n)\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    title='',\\\n    xaxis= {'title':\" \"},yaxis = {'title':\" \"}\n)\n\nfig = go.Figure(data = [white_trace,black_trace,gray_trace,silver_trace,red_trace], layout = layout)\niplot(fig)\n\nAs I previously guessed, the white cars are selling better in southern states such as Texas, California and by surprise in Michigan, which is northern state. \nBlack cars are popular in northern Pennsylvania. What is strange, that in southern Florida white cars are less popular than black ones. \nAt the same time other colours are also represented.\nIn conclusion I would say that US car drivers choose domestic cars (Fords and Dodges) with practical colours depending on the state.\nSummary\n- UA and US markets are very different. People in Ukraine preferred small Europeans sedans such as Volkswagen or Japan Toyota.

But anyway the previous transformations get us some enough good results and allow to work with data further. For a modelling it makes sense to use log-transformed charges or square-root-transformed charges and outliers replaced by medians. Deleting outliers helps partly only with kurtosis issue.\n\nAddition\nThe Box-Cox transformation is a technique to transform non-normal data into normal shape.\nBox-cox transformation attempts to transform a set of data to a normal distribution by finding the value of λ that minimises the variation, see more here\nskewed_box_cox, lmda = stats.boxcox(df['charges'])\nsns.distplot(skewed_box_cox)\n\ndf['boxcox'].skew()\n\n-0.008734097133920404\ndf['boxcox'].kurtosis()\n\n-0.6502935539475279\n\nBox-cox gives good results and can be used for 'charges' as Log-transformation\n\nBMI Distribution\nsns.distplot(df['bmi'])\n\nAt first glance, the distribution looks normal.\nShapiro Normality test\nThere is one more test allows to check normality of distribution. It is Shapiro test. For this spicy library can be use\nfrom scipy import stats\np_value = stats.shapiro(df['bmi'])[0]\nif p_value &lt;=0.05:\n    print(\"Distribution is non-normal\")\nelse:\n    print('Distribution is normal')\n\nDistribution is normal\ndf.agg(['skew', 'kurtosis'])['bmi'].transpose()\n\nskew        0.284047\nkurtosis   -0.050732\nName: bmi, dtype: float64\n\nInterim conclusions: BMI index distributed normally\n\nAge Distribution\nAs we see on the plot, ages density is quite equal, except age near 20.

This transformations are important for the further modelling applying. Some model are sensitive for the data view and data scientist has to investigate more in a data preparation.\nAs a result we can see, that Log-transformation is the most universal and effective technique. It solves most of the skewness and kurtosis problems. Box-Cox transformations are also effective and flexible.\nIt can happen that data looks non-normal, but in the same time it doesn't have some outliers or very high kurtosis. In this situation it make sense to analyse such data locally and adjust it manually, for example deleting data or replacing it for a median/mean/max/min/random etc. values.\n\n","id":"https://nnovakova.github.io/data-transformation/","title":"Basic Feature Engineering Techniques for ML"},"https://nnovakova.github.io/mlflow/":{"body":"MLFlow helps to data scientists to track their machine learning experiments. However, it provides more than that.\nSome of the main features:\n\n\nPython, Scala, Java SDK to log ML experiments metrics, parameters, ML model files\nGeneric packaging format for ML models\nModel Registry to manage ML models\nWeb UI\n\nI will show how one can integrate MLFlow into existing code. I will use my existing Python project, \nwhere I used Spacy to train ML model for NLP/NER task.\nInstallation\nWe can use pip:\npip install mlflow\n\nYou should have Conda or Miniconda tool installed to work with MLFlow. It can be install from here.\nOfficial documentation of MLFlow is quite good. You can use it, if you lost in my tutorial.\nWeb UI\nOnce MLFLow is installed, you can run its Web UI locally. You can also run it on your central server to be able to work in the team, so that you all will\nbe able to see each other experiments. Start UI via the following command:\nmlflow ui\n\nmlflow is now your CLI tool that was installed via pip earlier. We will be using later for running experiments as well.\nOpen web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000, if mlflow ui was executed successfully, i.e. it should be running in your shell.\nIn my case, I have such output in my shell:\nmlflow ui\n\n[2020-11-11 21:35:44 +0100] [43202] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.0.4\n[2020-11-11 21:35:44 +0100] [43202] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:5000 (43202)\n[2020-11-11 21:35:44 +0100] [43202] [INFO] Using worker: sync\n[2020-11-11 21:35:44 +0100] [43205] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 43205\nUsing MLFLow SDK\nWe are going to use MLFlow package which was install by pip as well. In order to integrate MLFlow with any Python code, we just need\nto import its package and use a couple functions to log our experiment metric.\nfrom mlflow import log_metric, log_param, log_artifacts\nimport mlflow.spacy\n\nNow we can use imported functions while training an ML model. Also, we import mlflow-spacy integration to save and load a Spacy model later in the code.\ndef train_spacy(data, iterations, drop_rate):\n    nlp = spacy.blank('de')    \n    ner_pipe = 'ner'\n    if ner_pipe not in nlp.pipe_names:\n        ner = nlp.create_pipe(ner_pipe)\n        nlp.add_pipe(ner, last=True)\n    else:\n        ner = nlp.get_pipe(ner_pipe)\n    \n    for _, annotations in data:\n        for ent in annotations.get('entities'):\n            ner.add_label(ent[2])\n\n    log_param(\"drop_rate\", drop_rate)  # &lt;-- MLFlow tracking\n    log_param(\"iterations\", iterations) # &lt;-- MLFlow tracking\n    \n    other_pipes = [pipe for pipe in nlp.pipe_names if pipe != ner_pipe]\n    with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes):  # only train NER    \n        warnings.filterwarnings(\"once\", category=UserWarning, module='spacy')\n        optimizer = nlp.begin_training()\n        for itn in range(iterations):\n            print(\"Statring iteration \" + str(itn))\n            random.shuffle(data)\n            losses = {}\n            for text, annotations in data:\n                nlp.update(\n                    [text],  # batch of texts\n                    [annotations],  # batch of annotations\n                    drop=drop_rate,  # dropout - make it harder to memorise data\n                    sgd=optimizer,  # callable to update weights\n                    losses=losses)\n            log_metric(\"ner.losses\", value=losses[ner_pipe], step=itn) # &lt;-- MLFlow tracking\n    return nlp\n\nThere are three places where we log our algorithm parameters and one metric \"ner.losses\". When we launch above code, it will log \nthose values to local MLFlow file repository. One can also point MLFlow SDK to use remote server that will store all logged parameters, metrics and artefacts.\nLet's call this function and store output model file into MLFlow file repository:\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='NER Model training')\nparser.add_argument('-d', dest='drop_rate', type=float,\n                    help='SpaCy drop rate for training [0.0..0.9]')\nparser.add_argument('-i', dest='iterations', type=int,\n                    help='Number of iterations')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\ntraining_data = transform_json('med-corpus.json')\nprdnlp = train_spacy(training_data, args.iterations, args.drop_rate)\nmlflow.spacy.log_model(spacy_model=prdnlp, artifact_path=\"model\")\n\n\nWe parse script arguments to pass their values to train_spacy function. \nWe read the training data from JSON file and transform it to \nSpacy format. \nOnce training data is available, we call train_spacy to get a model object as a result of the training. \nLast line is saving Spacy model via MLFlow API to MLFlow file repository.\n\nUsing MLFlow CLI\nIn order to start using MLFlow as CLI, we should add MLProject yaml file to source project \ndirectory:\nname: NER Medical Entities\n\nconda_env: conda.yaml\n\nentry_points:\n  main:\n    parameters:      \n      drop_rate: {type: float, default: 0.2}\n      iterations: {type: int, default: 20}\n    command: \"python train_ner_model.py -d {drop_rate} -i {iterations}\"\n  test:\n    parameters:\n      run_id: {type: string}\n    command: \"python test_ner_model.py -r {run_id}\"\n\nAbove files described MLProject entry points that we can execute via MLFlow CLI. Before doing that,\nwe will create an experiment entry in the MLFlow file repository by running:\nmlflow experiments create -n ner-medicine-spacy\n\nIt will output something like this:\n...\nCreated experiment 'ner-medicine-spacy' with id 1\nmlflow run -e main . -P drop_rate=0.25 -P iterations=30 --experiment-id 1\n...\n... INFO mlflow.projects: === Run (ID 'a689830e6fe245c8a2b025b4a2edee1a') succeeded ===\n\nrun is one of the option of mlflow CLI. It can execute one of the entry point from MLProject file. Above command executes main entry point which is training python script. We pass\ntwo paramters via CLI that will be passed to the script as \"-d {drop_rate} -i {iterations}\". Then,\nthe train_ner_model.py script will parse these parameters as scipt arguments to be used \nfor train_spacy function. \nAt this point we can already see an entry at MLFlow UI under experiment name ner-medicine-spacy.\nChasing best parameters\nMy NER Spacy machine learning model gets better, if you have smaller loss function value. So we can go ahead and run below command with different parameters with get smallest loss value.\nmlflow run -e main . \\\n -P drop_rate=&lt;some value between 0 and 0.9&gt; \\\n -P iterations=&lt;some value more than 0&gt; \\\n --experiment-id 1\n\nSo I did that and got all runs logged in MLFlow:\n\nIf I click on the last run, I even can see how loss function is\nmoving on each iteration of learning process:\n\nIf go to my last run again and scroll down, I can see that my model\nwas saved as part of my local project file repository. Every\nrun gets unique id, so that I can easily find my Spacy model and use it for\ndeployment in production or share it to my team. Register Model button shows up, if I click on the model tree at the left hand side. This feature is designed to register my model from a specific training run to a remote or local MLFlow instance. Most of the time you will be using this feature with remote/shared instance of MLFlow.\n\nSummary\nMLFlow is useful tool to visualise machine learning experiments locally \nand share experiment result in the team via remote instance. MLFlow comes also with deployment APIs to expose a machine learning model as a RESTful service for scoring purposes. Unified model packaging format is perhaps one of the important feature, which helps to reproduce a machine learning experiment in another environment and move your machine model to production.\nLinks\nFull project source code on GitHub: https://github.com/nnovakova/mlflow-spacy\n","id":"https://nnovakova.github.io/mlflow/","title":"Tracking ML experiments with MLFlow"},"https://nnovakova.github.io/opennlp-ner-annotaton/":{"body":"Why NLP?\nNatural language processing is a component of Text Mining that performs a special kind of linguistic analysis that essentially helps a machine\nto read text.

Thus NER is just one in the list of NLP tasks.\n\nNER has a lot of synonyms, such as Entity Identification, Entity Chunking and Entity Extraction. \nNamed Entity Recognition is a process of finding named-entities (entities, valuable for some special domain) in the text.\nStandard kinds of entities looking for (using NER) in texts are:\n\nPerson.\nOrganization.\nLocation.\n\nLet's clarify some common terms used in NLP:\n\nGazetteers (List of Seeds, Seeds, Named Entity Lists): list of domain entities. \nCorpus (Corpora): a huge natural language text representing special domain.\nAnnotation (Markup process): process of entities marking-up in a corpus.\nLearning process: training/testing process using annotated corpus.\n\nNER via OpenNLP library\nWe can use Apache OpenNLP library to implement above process.\nApache OpenNLP has a standard pipeline for NLP learning process:\n\nPreparing List of Entities\nAnnotating corpus / Use OpenNLP corpus\nTraining OpenNLP Parameters\nTraining own model / Use pre-trained models for corresponding corpus\nTesting model with relevant data\n\n1. Named-entity list preparations\nThere are a lot of examples how to use Apache OpenNLP standard domain with models by default. I would like to make the task more complex. In this case, let us\ncustomize NER for medical domain and allow model to find medical entities in text documents.\nWe will try to learn model to find special entities in German language. There are no pretrained German models for Apache OpenNLP.\nFor the construction of a list of medical entities,  I used MeSH open-sourced database.\nMedical Subject Headings (MeSH) DB – is a poly-hierarchical, concept-based thesaurus for the cataloging of book and media collections, indexing of databases and creation of search profiles in medical domain. Terms are extracted in the separate file where each line contains just one seed.\n2. Corpus preparation\nCorpus is important step of NER. Let us prepare an unlabelled corpus. Apache OpenNLP has a strict syntax for that. \nCorpus requirements:\n\nhave lots of data. In OpenNLP documentation, it is recommended a minimum of 15000 sentences.\nentities should be surrounded by tags in format &lt;START:entity-name&gt; Entity &lt;END&gt;.  Entity name is a label of entities your learning model is going to look for.\nadd spaces between tags (START/END) and labeled data.\nif possible, use one label per model. Multiple labels are possible, but it is not recommended.\neach line contains just one sentence. \nempty lines delimit documents.\n\nNext steps 3-5 will be described in the next article.\nProject source code using OpenNLP you can found here: https://github.com/nnovakova/opennlp-annotator\n","id":"https://nnovakova.github.io/opennlp-ner-annotaton/","title":"NER using OpenNLP. Data Preparation."},"https://nnovakova.github.io/opennlp-ner-train-test/":{"body":"In the previous article I described how to prepare training data (corpus) for training with OpenNLP for a specific domain and custom entities. \n\nNow it is time to use annotated corpus for the next stage of NLP pipeline.\nBefore, we completed the first step of the pipeline – training data preparation. Now it is time to start real learning process.\nBut before we start next step, let's list basic OpenNLP conditions:\n\nHave enough data  (starts from 15 000 sentences in corpus).\nCorpus must to be annotated.\nCorpus must contain single language text.\nWrite Java code to use OpenNLP API. \n\nIf these conditions are met, then you can start training.\n3. Training a model\nBelow, in all code snippets I am using Java 11 that allows to use var keywords for local variables.\n3.1 Read the training data\nvar in = new MarkableFileInputStreamFactory(new File(filePath));\nvar sampleStream = new NameSampleDataStream(new PlainTextByLineStream(in, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\n3.2 Training Parameters\nvar params = new TrainingParameters();\nparams.put(TrainingParameters.ITERATIONS_PARAM, 100);// number of training iterations\nparams.put(TrainingParameters.CUTOFF_PARAM, 3);//minimal number of times a feature must be seen\nparams.put(TrainingParameters.ALGORITHM_PARAM, ModelType.MAXENT.toString());\n3.3 Train the model\nvar nameFinderFactory = TokenNameFinderFactory.create(\n    null, null, Collections.emptyMap(), new BioCodec());\nString type = null; // null - to use entity names from the corpus annotations\nmodel = NameFinderME.train(\"de\", type, sampleStream, params, nameFinderFactory);\n3.4 Save the model to a file\ntry (BufferedOutputStream modelOut = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(onlpModelPath))) {\n    model.serialize(modelOut);\n}\n4. Validate Mode\nWe need to load the model from the binary file to validate it:\ntry (InputStream modelIn = new FileInputStream(Config.onlpModelPath)) {\n    var model = new TokenNameFinderModel(modelIn);\n    var nameFinder = new NameFinderME(model);\n    var sentence = \"Keine Mittellinienverlagerung.\\n\" +\n            \"Keine intrakranielle Blutung.\\n\" +\n            \"Kein klares fokales, kein generalisiertes Hirnödem.\\n\" +\n            \"Derzeit keine eindeutige frische, keine grobe alte Ischämie.\";\n    ;\n    sentence = sentence.replaceAll(\"(?!\\\\s)\\\\W\", \" $0\");\n    var words = sentence.split(\" \");\n\n    // Get NE in sentence and positions of found NE\n    var nameSpans = nameFinder.find(words);\n    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nameSpans));\n\n    for (Span span : nameSpans) {\n        var ent = words[span.getStart()];\n        System.out.println(ent);\n    }\n}\n\nAs a result you'll get a serial number of entities in the text + entity type name and a list of entities:\n[[3..4) med-entity, [5..6) med-entity, [7..8) med-entity, [15..16) med-entity, [21..23) med-entity]\nIsolierung\nH5N1\nMenschen\nVirus\nPandemieausl\nSummary\nOpenNLP is a robust and free open source alternative for NER task solving. \nThe biggest problem when using OpenNLP is a corpus preparation. It takes a lot of resources and requires accurate annotation.

Spark provides an API in several languages such as Scala, Java and Python.\nToday I would like to show you how to use Python and PySpark to do data analytics in Spark SQL API. \nI will also use Plotly library to visualise processed data.\nDatasets\nI am going to use public datasets available at:\n\nResidential Property Prices for Germany\nBank interest rates - Loans to euro area households\n\nThe first dataset contains calendar quarter column that we will use to join with second dataset that has the same column. However, we will\nneed first to do some data preparation to be able to join these two datasets. \nColumns we are interested in:\n\nPrices: quarter and price index. There are no other columns so we take both.\nLoans: quarter is at index 0 and interest rate percent is at index 4. We skip all other columns.\n\nImplementation\nWe will use such libraries:\n\npyspark\nplotly\ndatetime\n\nWe will need to following imports:\nimport pyspark\nimport datetime\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom plotly.offline import plot\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession, SQLContext\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import FloatType, DateType, StructType, StructField\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import to_date, col, date_format\nCSV files into Spark Dataframes\nAt the very beginning we need to create few objects for Spark runtime:\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName('LoanVsPrices').getOrCreate()\nsc = spark.sparkContext\nsqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\n\nWe will use them later in the program code.\nLoans\nNow we can can read the first dataset for the loans using manually defined schema:\nloanSchema = StructType([\n    StructField(\"quarterDate\", DateType(), True),\n    StructField(\"percent\", FloatType(), True)])\n\nloanDf = spark.sparkContext \\\n    .textFile(\"data.csv\") \\\n    .zipWithIndex() \\\n    .filter(lambda x: x[1] &gt; 5) \\\n    .map(lambda x: x[0].split(',')) \\\n    .map(lambda x: (datetime.strptime(x[0], '%Y%b'), float(x[4]))) \\\n    .toDF(loanSchema)\n\nWhile reading data.csv file we skip first 5 header rows. Then we split each row by comma and we take only 0 and 4 columns. \nWe parse them into Date and Float types respectively.\nPrices\npriceSchema = StructType([\n    StructField(\"quarterDate\", DateType(), True),\n    StructField(\"index2010\", FloatType(), True)])\n\npriceDf = spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"header\", True) \\\n    .schema(priceSchema) \\\n    .load(\"QDEN628BIS.csv\") \\\n    .select(to_date(col(\"quarterDate\")).alias(\"quarterDate\"), col(\"index2010\"))\n\nWe use similar schema for reading prices. This time we use standard Spark API to read CVS files, since the prices file is much simpler as it has only one row as header \nand exactly two column that we need.\nDebug\nWe can also print Spark DataFrame schemas and data samples for both datasets.\nloanDf.show()\nloanDf.printSchema()\n\npriceDf.show()\npriceDf.printSchema()\n+-----------+-------+\n|quarterDate|percent|\n+-----------+-------+\n| 2020-07-01|   1.24|\n| 2020-06-01|   1.28|\n| 2020-05-01|   1.27|\n| 2020-04-01|   1.22|\n| 2020-03-01|   1.18|\n| 2020-02-01|   1.26|\n| 2020-01-01|   1.35|\n| 2019-12-01|   1.27|\n| 2019-11-01|   1.25|\n| 2019-10-01|   1.22|\n| 2019-09-01|   1.24|\n| 2019-08-01|   1.36|\n| 2019-07-01|   1.49|\n| 2019-06-01|   1.61|\n| 2019-05-01|   1.67|\n| 2019-04-01|   1.72|\n| 2019-03-01|   1.79|\n| 2019-02-01|   1.85|\n| 2019-01-01|   1.95|\n| 2018-12-01|   1.94|\n+-----------+-------+\nonly showing top 20 rows\n\nroot\n |-- quarterDate: date (nullable = true)\n |-- percent: float (nullable = true)\n+-----------+---------+\n|quarterDate|index2010|\n+-----------+---------+\n| 1970-01-01|  37.6187|\n| 1970-04-01|   39.315|\n| 1970-07-01|  39.7142|\n| 1970-10-01|  40.2131|\n| 1971-01-01|  41.5103|\n| 1971-04-01|   43.506|\n| 1971-07-01|  44.1047|\n| 1971-10-01|  44.2045|\n| 1972-01-01|  45.1025|\n| 1972-04-01|  46.2002|\n| 1972-07-01|  46.6991|\n| 1972-10-01|  46.9984|\n| 1973-01-01|  47.6969|\n| 1973-04-01|  49.8922|\n| 1973-07-01|  50.3911|\n| 1973-10-01|  50.3911|\n| 1974-01-01|  51.4887|\n| 1974-04-01|  53.5842|\n| 1974-07-01|  54.0831|\n| 1974-10-01|  53.7838|\n+-----------+---------+\nonly showing top 20 rows\n\nroot\n |-- quarterDate: date (nullable = true)\n |-- index2010: float (nullable = true)\nJoin via SQL\nNow we can use Spar SQL to join both dataframes using quarterDate column:\npriceDf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"price\")\nloanDf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"loan\")\n\njoined = spark.sql(\n    \"select p.quarterDate, l.percent, p.index2010 from price p inner join loan l on p.quarterDate = l.quarterDate order by p.quarterDate\") \\\n    .toPandas()\n\nFirst, we define temporary SQL views to be able to reference our dataframes in SQL expressions.\nThen we use plain SQL to join both dataframes on quarterDate column and return 3 column as a result.\nPySpark is also integrated with Pandas, so that we convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame to be able to use it further with Plotly library\nWe can also preview the joined data via python code print(joined)\n   quarterDate  percent   index2010\n0   2000-01-01     6.71  101.183899\n1   2000-04-01     6.56  101.403297\n2   2000-07-01     6.72  101.462097\n3   2000-10-01     6.70  101.441597\n4   2001-01-01     6.24  101.421303\n..         ...      ...         ...\n76  2019-01-01     1.95  146.000000\n77  2019-04-01     1.72  149.699997\n78  2019-07-01     1.49  151.800003\n79  2019-10-01     1.22  155.500000\n80  2020-01-01     1.35  155.899994\n\n[81 rows x 3 columns]\nVisualize via Plotly\nBefore we use these joined data in the plot, we need to normalise the numbers, so that will look nicer on the plot. Normalisation also gives ability \nto compare both datasets on the same plot. If we do not normalise then Y axis will be too high, so that it will be hard to compare both scatter plots visually.\ndef normalize(df, feature_name):\n    result = df.copy()\n    max_value = df[feature_name].max()\n    min_value = df[feature_name].min()\n    result[feature_name] = (\n        df[feature_name] - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)\n    return result[feature_name]\n\npercentValues = normalize(joined, \"percent\")\nindexValues = normalize(joined, \"index2010\")\n\nAfter normalisation we can use Plotly API to make a plot and save it into HTML file:\ndata = [\n    go.Scatter(x=joined.quarterDate, y=percentValues,\n               name=\"% Loan for House Purchase\", text=joined.percent),\n    go.Scatter(x=joined.quarterDate, y=indexValues,\n               name=\"Residential Property Price (quarterly)\", text=joined.index2010)\n]\nfig = go.Figure(data, layout_title_text=\"Loan vs. Property Price\")\nplot(fig, filename='plot.html')\n\nIf we open plot.html file in the internet browser, then it will look like the following:\n\nData Analyst Summary\nDespite the 2008 financial crisis in housing led to price drop, the house purchase loan got increased and still increasing up to 2020 year.\nBank loan interest rate may seem cheap, but regular house prices increases dramatically, so that cheap loan does not help that much. One has to still pay a lot\nin order to afford a house or own apartment.\nSummary\nWe have seen that one can easily use PySpark and its SQL API to process and analyse the data. In real life, we should not use use Spark to analyse such \nsmall files, this can be done using other Python libraries. However, this example can be used to write another program to analyse peta-byte scale data\nusing Spark cluster with massive parallelism.\nLinks\n\nGitHub Project: https://github.com/nnovakova/pyspark-plotly\nPlotly Documentation\nSpark SQL Documentation\n\n","id":"https://nnovakova.github.io/pyspark-plotly/","title":"PySpark & Plotly"},"https://nnovakova.github.io/python-type-checkers/":{"body":"As I am working with Java code, I also find static types in my project as a useful thing. They help me to reason about my code\nand avoid simple bugs, for example if I pass incorrect argument to some method or function. \n\nPython is a dynamically-typed language. \nThis property makes it faster to write code, but NOT necessarily easier to read. Type annotations and type checkers appeared in Python not so long time ago. Today, there are several type checkers in Python eco-system:\n\nMypy - first static type checker for Python, initiated in 2012 and still in active development. Uses type annotations to check program correctness.\nPyre - created by Facebook, uses type annotations. User can switch on the \"strict mode\" to raise errors on missing type annotations.\nPytype - created by Google. Uses type inference technique, instead of only using type annotations.\n\nThere are might be other type checkers, but I mainly looked into those. In this blog-post, I only discuss Mypy type checker. \nMypy\nAll type checkers in Python are based on the successful work being done in PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposal):\n\nPEP 484 - Type Hints\nPEP 526 - Syntax for Variable Annotations\nPEP 612 - Parameter Specification Variables\n\nType annotations can be used for variables, method arguments and return types. \nThere are many other type features like generics, but I will skip that in this blog-post.\nMypy comes as command line tool plus several other tools for typing, library stubs and more. Let's install it and try on a simple program.\nInstallation\nMypy requires Python version &gt;= 3.5. You can install it using pip:\npython3 -m pip install mypy\nUsage\nOnce Mypy is in your environment, you can run it via command line interface to type check you Python source file, module or entire workspace.\nmypy &lt;myfile&gt;.py\n\nBelow example has two lines where we have bugs:\n# pizza.py\n\nclass Pizza:\n    def __init__(self, name: str, count: int):\n        self.name = name\n        self.count = count\n\n\ndef order_pizza(name: str, count: int) -&gt; Pizza:\n    return Pizza(count, name) # bug: count and name swapped\n\norder_pizza(2, \"spinacci\") # bug: count and name swapped\n\nLet's run Mypy to catch these bugs:\nmypy pizza.py\npizza.py:8: error: Argument 1 to \"Pizza\" has incompatible type \"int\"; expected \"str\"\npizza.py:8: error: Argument 2 to \"Pizza\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"int\"\npizza.py:11: error: Argument 1 to \"order_pizza\" has incompatible type \"int\"; expected \"str\"\npizza.py:11: error: Argument 2 to \"order_pizza\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"int\"\nFound 4 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n\nAs you can see, Mypy reports that we pass int value to a function where string value is expected and vice versa.\nLet's fix these bugs and run Mypy again:\ndef order_pizza(name: str, count: int) -&gt; Pizza:\n    return Pizza(name, count)\n\norder_pizza(\"spinacci\", 2)\nmypy pizza.py\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n\nIf we miss function argument(s), Mypy reports it as well:\ndef order_pizza(name: str, count: int) -&gt; Pizza:\n    return Pizza(name, count)\n\norder_pizza(\"spinacci\")\n mypy pizza.py\npizza.py:10: error: Too few arguments for \"order_pizza\"\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n\nIn case we put wrong return value, then we get an error as well:\ndef order_pizza(name: str, count: int) -&gt; Pizza:\n    return \"Pizza(name, count)\"\n\norder_pizza(\"spinacci\", 2)\nmypy pizza.py\npizza.py:8: error: Incompatible return value type (got \"str\", expected \"Pizza\")\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n\nMypy can also type check Python 2 code.\n3rd party libraries\nMypy provides type definitions via the typeshed repository, \nwhich contains library stubs for the Python builtins, the standard library, and selected third-party packages.\nType stub is python code that contains only class, function definitions with types. \nMypy can automatically find type stubs for a library if it has a type stub. \nOtherwise, Mypy will report an error that types are missing for a specific module:\n# test.py\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame\nmypy test.py\ntest.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing 'pyspark': found module but no type hints or library stubs\ntest.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n\nAs you can see above, pyspark package does not provide type stubs on its own. However, there is open-source package \npyspark-stubs, which we need to install to add Mypy type stubs for PySpark to our environment:\npip install pyspark-stubs\n\nOnce it is installed, we can successfully run Mypy and use PySpark types in our code.\nmypy test.py\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\nConfiguration\nMypy can read user-defined configuration from mypy.ini file. One the convenient use case is to disable type checking for a specific library or\nits module:\n# mypy.ini\n[mypy]\n\n[mypy-pyspark.sql.*]\nignore_missing_imports = True\n\nAbove config sections ignore missing imports for pyspark.sql module of pyspark library.\nType Stubs for an external library\nThere are a lot of libraries which do not have type stubs as of today, neither in typeshed repository nor as separate pip package. \nIn this case, one can create own type stubs using Mypy and keep in own project repository. \nThere are a couple examples how to create your stubs and install them, so that Mypy can see your own stubs for specific library:\n\nMypy wiki\nPyCharm - Create a stub file\n\nLet's try to provide type stub for one of the Plotly module.\n\nCreate local hierarchy that mirrors python file naming convention:\n\n|myproject\n├── stubs\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── plotly\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     ├── __init__.pyi\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── graph_objs\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;         └── __init__.pyi\n└── test.py\n\n\nWe put only one class constuctor definition as an example:\n\n# stubs/plotly/graph_objs/__init__.pyi\n\nfrom typing import Any\n\nclass Scatter:\n    def __init__(self, x: Any, y: Any, name: str, text: Any): ...\n\n\nIn a caller script test.py we instantiate Scatter class:\n\n# test.py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nplot = go.Scatter(0, 1, \"\", 3)\n\n\nDefine environment variable to point stubs directory:\n\nexport MYPYPATH=~/myproject/stubs\n\n\nFinally, we run type checker:\n\nmypy test.pyt\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n\nScatter constructor definition was provided from our own type stubs.\nStubgen\nAbove example is based on manual type stub creation, however Mypy project also provides stubgen tool to create a stub draft automatically.\nAuto-generated stub requires then manual updates to get rid of Any types, which are inferred in many cases.\nConclusion\nAs a Data Scientist I do not really define new types, but rather using a lot of Python libraries to write a sequence of steps as a script.\nI do not really write complex systems with a lot of own libraries. So Type Checkers are not really critical to me, however it is nice to\nhave such tool around. Type annotations are great, especially if the help IDEs to provide better development experience via auto-completion \nand type hints. Sometimes I can annotate my own functions, this serves me as a documentation. \nIt is quite useful, when I am reading my code in a couple of months in future.\n","id":"https://nnovakova.github.io/python-type-checkers/","title":"Python Type Checkers"}},"docInfo":{"https://nnovakova.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://nnovakova.github.io/ads-analysis/":{"body":2834,"title":5},"https://nnovakova.github.io/cars-analysis/":{"body":1032,"title":5},"https://nnovakova.github.io/cv/":{"body":442,"title":1},"https://nnovakova.github.io/data-transformation/":{"body":1406,"title":5},"https://nnovakova.github.io/mlflow/":{"body":725,"title":4},"https://nnovakova.github.io/opennlp-ner-annotaton/":{"body":309,"title":5},"https://nnovakova.github.io/opennlp-ner-train-test/":{"body":287,"title":6},"https://nnovakova.github.io/pyspark-plotly/":{"body":773,"title":2},"https://nnovakova.github.io/python-type-checkers/":{"body":767,"title":3}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};
